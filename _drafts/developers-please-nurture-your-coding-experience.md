Whether you are writing code for a living, or just enjoying it as a hobby, it is very likely you are spending a good portion of your day on a computer if you are reading this article.

I see writing code as an art. An art where we would each approach it from a different perspective, playing with the tools that we are being offered. We all enjoy at a different level of the stack. And yet it all comes down to solving problems by editing some code in a form or another.

Editing code in itself is trivial. Projecting and mapping our thoughts into concrete lines of code is a different kind of beast. But what is the link between you and the code you write? Your machine. Your workstation. Your work environment. You call it the way you want, but that's what enabling you to write code.

I believe taking ownership of one's environment is a key facet of becoming a better engineer. Some people would argue it brings a productivity boost. But I don't think that's the main reason. The main reason is getting all potential obstacles out of the way.

We should all get to know our environments. Caring about your work environment will be beneficial in the long run. For you. For your coworkers. Not only that, but it will give you a better understanding of what represents a good environment, and that will help you down the road.

That being said, where can you start? There is so much to do. Well, the bad news is it's a never ending journey. The great news is that it's a never ending journey. Every second of it will make you better at your job. It is not about coding as fast as possible, it's about getting comfortable and maximizing the environment you are using every day.

## Begin your journey

This is a personal journey. You might (and should) take inspiration from others, but in the end you are designing the workstation that works the best for you. And you will carry it around across all your jobs and personal projects.

The best way to start is by identifying pain points. Where are you wasting your time? Look at the tasks you are doing the most frequently, and try to optimize them. Look at the chores that feel the most daunting to you, and automate them away.

- Do you find yourself doing a lot of typos? Go to [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) and learn to touch type.
- Do you waste a lot of time switching back and forth between your editor and your terminal to restart your project? Use an autoreloader like [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)
- Do you find your shell slow? Start from an empty configuration file and take the time to only add the bits you need. My [`.zshrc`](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles/blob/0d8dc7488ceae7262934ba17a5bf31b77a7264ff/.zshrc) is only 200 lines of code (+ 3 plugins).
- Do you waste a lot of time adding debug logs to your code? Learn how to use a debugger
- You waste a lot of time or struggle understanding how your code behaves in production? Learn how to instrument your code.

These are only examples, and some of these might sound silly. But I've seen people painfully repeating the same behaviors over and over. If that's your case: you can fix it. Identify the problems, find solutions, apply those solutions.

## Practical advices

- Don't make your stack complicated. When you can, [choose simplicity over complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4). Remove the tools you don't need.
- Challenge your existing stack on a regular basis. Keep digging for ways to improve it.
- Know when to stop, but understand the limitations of your workflow.
- Find the smallest set of tools required to do the job. Get to know these tools really well, and find ways to integrate them together.

## Final words

This is _your_ journey. Give it time and you will be rewarded.
