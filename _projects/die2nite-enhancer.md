This is a browser extension for the game
[Die2Nite](http://www.die2nite.com/#index). It is compatible with the English,
[French](http://www.hordes.fr/), [Spanish](http://www.zombinoia.com/), and
[German](http://www.dieverdammten.de/) versions of the game.

The extension was adding a bunch of features to make the gameplay more
enjoyable. Most of the modifications were happening at the UI level, but it also
provided integrations with third-party services. It was one of the most popular
extensions for the game at the time, and was regularly
[recommended](http://d2nwiki.com/wiki/Applications#Die2Nite_Enhancer).

It was published on the
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/die2nite-enhancer/imkkdabijgkodinlhgncdfmghdcdacmg),
Firefox,
[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/die2nite-enhancer/), and
[Safari](http://safariaddons.com/en-US/safari/addon/227) stores. Furthermore, it
was also available as a
[GreaseMonkey](https://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/242398) script.

The extension was developed with Vanilla JS, with a handmade layer of code to
allow cross-browser compatibility.

I stopped working on the script when I stopped playing back in 2014. But the
project was forked and is still actively
[maintained](https://depot.vwa.re/ludofloria/myhordes-enhancer/).
