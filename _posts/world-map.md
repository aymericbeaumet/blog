I wanted to create a Tolkien-like map with real-world data. The data comes from [geonames.org](https://download.geonames.org) and [geojson.xyz](http://geojson.xyz).

The goal was also to experiment with [GeoHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash), [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org). I had to develop a custom features index that supports multiple zoom level to always show the most meaningful data.

[Have fun!](https://maps.aymericbeaumet.com)
