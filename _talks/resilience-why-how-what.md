We live in a world critically relying on a growing mass of information systems:
whether it be for APIs, automation, synchronizing services, or any other
server-side operation. But how do these systems react in case of failure?

As a back-end engineer, it is your job to implement a resilient system. Through
this talk, we will look into some erroneous Node.js implementations and see how
we can articulate coherent strategies to solve these issues.

_This talk was given in French. The slides are in English._
