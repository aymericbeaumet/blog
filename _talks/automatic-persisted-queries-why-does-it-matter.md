[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is not to be presented anymore. One main
drawback though in comparison to REST is the upstream bandwidth cost can become significant as the number of queries increases.

[Automatic Persisted Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)
aims at addressing this problem by allowing to cache the queries server-side.
They can then be queried again through a unique identifier sent by the backend.

Unfortunately this talk was not recorded, but you can find the slides below.
