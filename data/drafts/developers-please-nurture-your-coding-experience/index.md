// Why?

We spend a lot of time on computers, worth improving. It's not about coding as
fast as possible, it's about getting comfortable and maximizing the environment
you are using everyday.

// How?

Optimizing the whole stack. Identify painpoints and fix them. Only give
examples, we'll write specific blog posts later.

This article is not meant to be followed to the letter, but it's food for
thought.

## Prioritize

Get a few tools that you will learn to master, and find ways to improve their
interoperability.

## Share

- when you can, choose simplicity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4
- talk with people
- read blog posts
- challenge your existing stack with newcoming tools
- accept to stay with your current stack if you are happy with it, but
  understand what you are missing
- keeping your stack up to date
- cut the noise, remove what you don't need so you can focus on what's most
  important
- autoreload, hotreload, tdd

## Optimizations

- Use your keyboard more, use your mouse less.
- Gradually learn the shortcuts for the apps you use often
- Learn to touch type, it's not about speed but accuracy
  (https://www.keybr.com/).
- Consider an alternative layout like Colemak https://colemak.com/

### Operating system

- It doesn't matter which one you use
- Learn how to get the most out of your OS
- Learn how to customize your OS

### Terminal / Shell

- It doesn't matter which one you use
- Must be fast
- Stay away from distributions
- Synchronize your dotfiles in a git repository
  https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles
- Public is great so you can easily share with other people

https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc

### Code editor

- It doesn't matter which one you use
- Stay with something classic unless you are willing to spend a lot of time
- Make sure you get completion and debugging working

## Conclusion

- Create your own niche where you feel comfortable.
- Practice and get used to your stack We've seen 3 main axis to improve your
  workflow.
