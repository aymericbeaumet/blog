Must have:

- super fast to load

What I end up doing:

- alias the most commonly used commands to one letter aliases (`git` -> `g`,
  `kubectl` -> `k`, etc)
- make extensive use of [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- the fastest prompt in town is
  [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

Have a look at my
[`.zshrc`](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles/blob/master/src/.zshrc) in
my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles).
