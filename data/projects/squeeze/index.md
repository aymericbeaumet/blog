I've always been frustrated at my ability to extract data when I was working
from the terminal. Extracting URLs, codetags (`// TODO:`, etc) is something that
I often do, and it is always resulting in me struggling to get `grep` to do what
I need.

This project aims at solving this frustration, and allows to extract data from
arbitrary sources. Check the
[readme](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/squeeze#squeeze-) to see all the
posssible data formats recognized.
