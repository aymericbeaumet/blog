My name's Aymeric, I'm a Software Engineer from France. These days I'm mainly
working on a Go and Kubernetes stack as a Platform Team Lead for
[REKKI](https://rekki.com/). I'm also enjoying working with Rust on some
[personal
projects](https://github.com/aymericbeaumet?tab=repositories&language=rust).
